## Project Overview  
*Weightless Odyssey* is a real-time simulation game where players assess and resolve critical system failures in a spacecraft. Players must also predict the motion and risk of interstellar bodies and space debris during interstellar travel. This game combines critical thinking and risk assessment with survival mechanics.

### Focus & Main Ideas  
- **Health Effects in Microgravity**:  
  - Muscle Atrophy  
  - Osteoporosis  
  - Fluid Shift  
  - Cardiovascular Deconditioning  
  - Immune System Suppression  
  - Radiation Exposure  

- **Asteroid Characteristics & Motion Prediction**  
  Players assess and avoid asteroid impacts through prediction models.

- **Critical Failure Assessment**  
  Players react to and resolve issues such as:
  - Oxygen module failure  
  - Food contamination  
  - Power overload  
  - Thruster failure  

### Gameplay  
1. Players begin orbiting Earth, performing tasks and managing their health.
2. They embark on a long-distance space journey, encountering various interstellar threats.
3. Players face critical failures and must make decisions through thorough assessment and knowledge.
4. They manage their **Physical** and **Mental Health** metrics through regular maintenance.

### How to Win  
The objective is to survive the journey. The game features customizable survival duration settings, allowing players to set an end goal to win.

## Inspiration  
This game was inspired by the real conditions of the **James Webb Space Telescope**, which was struck by a meteoroid between May 22-24. The game proposes a theoretical solution to avoid such incidents in space travel.

### Asteroids Prediction Model  
Throughout the journey, players assess the motion of rogue space debris and adjust their trajectory to avoid damage. Failure to do so may result in mission failure.
